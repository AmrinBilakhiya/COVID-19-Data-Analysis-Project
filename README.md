# COVID-19 Data Analysis Project

This project is a comprehensive data analysis of the global COVID-19 pandemic using Python and Jupyter Notebook. The analysis focuses on understanding the spread, trends, and impact of the virus across different countries using real-world datasets.

## 📌 Project Objectives
- Clean and preprocess COVID-19 data for analysis
- Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to uncover key insights
- Visualize trends such as daily case spikes, death rates, and recovery rates
- Identify most and least affected countries over time
- Use data storytelling to communicate the progression of the pandemic

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries Used
- **Python**
- **Pandas** – for data cleaning and manipulation
- **NumPy** – for numerical operations
- **Matplotlib** & **Seaborn** – for data visualization
- **Jupyter Notebook** – for development environment

## 📊 Key Insights
- Visual trends of confirmed, recovered, and death cases globally
- Country-wise comparison of infection rates
- Highest and lowest affected countries with time series graphs
- Mortality and recovery rate analysis
